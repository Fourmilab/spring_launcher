# Fourmilab Spring Launcher

[Fourmilab Spring Launcher](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Fourmilab-Spring-Launcher/18033331)
is a fun addition to your property in the
[Second Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life) virtual world
which brings a bit of Coyote and Roadrunner adventure to those who visit.

If you're afflicted with irritating roadrunners trespassing on your land,
try this spring launcher: It Might Just Work! When an avatar sits on the
launcher, the spring is triggered and avatar and launcher are hurled into
the sky, around 300 metres with the default settings. After a specified
interval (12 seconds by default), the user will be booted off the launcher
in mid-air and fall to the ground (unless they start to fly and land more
gracefully). The launcher immediately returns to its starting location
to welcome the next adventurer/victim.

The launcher is a fully functional flying vehicle. While riding the
launcher, the avatar can use the arrow keys to steer it and the Page
Up and Page Down keys to ascend and descend. This only affects the
position of the launcher while the avatar is seated; as soon as the
avatar stands up, or is booted off, the launcher will still return to
its original location. Settings allow configuring the launcher as a
pure flying machine, without the automatic launch and timed bail out,
or to allow an avatar to turn off the bail out by taking control of
the launcher and fly it manually.

The
[complete model](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Fourmilab-Spring-Launcher/18033331)
is available for free in the Second Life Marketplace.  This
repository contains everything in the model (except the prims
and spring mesh, which are objects built within Second Life), plus additional
resources for developers who may wish to extend or adapt the
model.  The model is delivered with permissions so
those who obtain it are free to copy and modify it as they wish.
Due to licensing restrictions on the spring mesh incorporated in the
product, it may not be transferred to other users in Second Life, but
since the product is free, they may simply obtain their own copies
from the Marketplace at no cost.
