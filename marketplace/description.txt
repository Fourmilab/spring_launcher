If you're afflicted with irritating roadrunners trespassing on your land, try this spring launcher: It Might Just Work!  When an avatar sits on the launcher, the spring is triggered and avatar and launcher are hurled into the sky, around 300 metres with the default settings.  After a specified interval (12 seconds by default), the user will be booted off the launcher in mid-air and fall to the ground (unless they start to fly and land more gracefully).  The launcher immediately returns to its starting location to welcome the next adventurer/victim.

The launcher is a fully functional flying vehicle.  While riding the launcher, the avatar can use the arrow keys to steer it and the Page Up and Page Down keys to ascend and descend.  This only affects the position of the launcher while the avatar is seated; as soon as the avatar stands up, or is booted off, the launcher will still return to its original location.  Settings allow configuring the launcher as a pure flying machine, without the automatic launch and timed bail out, or to allow an avatar to turn off the bail out by taking control of the launcher and fly it manually.

A development kit is included with texture and sound effects you may use in your builds.  The script may be modified or re-used as you wish.
